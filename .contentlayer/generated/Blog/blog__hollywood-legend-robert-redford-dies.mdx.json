    "raw": "\nRobert Redford, the lauded actor, director, activist, and founder of the Sundance Institute, has died at age 89. He passed quietly in his sleep at his home in Sundance, Utah — surrounded by those who loved him — family representatives confirmed.\n\n## From Screen Icon to Cultural Trailblazer\n\nRedford first came into the limelight in the 1960s and ’70s, earning acclaim with roles in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, The Way We Were, All the President’s Men, and more. Not only was he admired for his striking looks and charisma, he was also respected for choosing roles that carried depth and moral complexity.\n\nHis directorial work also left a profound mark — notably Ordinary People, which won him the Academy Award for Best Director. Beyond that, Redford’s founding of the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival helped give a platform to independent cinema, nurturing new voices and stories.\n\n## His Legacy and Passions Beyond Film\n\nRedford was more than an actor and director. He was an environmentalist, a political and social activist, deeply invested in preserving wilderness and giving voice to issues often sidelined in the mainstream. His life also included personal trials — the loss of children and navigating grief while remaining committed to his art and causes.\n\nHe formally stepped back from acting in recent years, though he made a surprise final screen cameo earlier in 2025.\nOutpouring of Tributes, Honor, and Influence\n\nNews of his passing sparked tributes from across the world — Hollywood peers, political leaders, artists, and activists. Many referred to him as a “lion” of American cinema, a visionary who helped shape what modern film could be.\n\nIndian cinema stars also joined in mourning his death — sharing photos, quotes, and heartfelt memories. Redford’s influence clearly stretched far beyond the U.S., inspiring global artists and audiences alike.\n\n## What He Leaves Behind\n\nRobert Redford leaves behind a towering legacy in film — both in his body of work as an actor and director, and in the artistic infrastructure he helped build through Sundance. He is survived by his wife, daughters, grandchildren, and a generation of filmmakers and artists whom he inspired.\n\nHis death marks the end of an era, but his contributions to cinema, activism, and storytelling will continue to resonate for decades to come.",
