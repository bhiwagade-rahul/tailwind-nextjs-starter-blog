    "raw": "\nPatrick Schwarzenegger and Abby Champion officially tied the knot on September 6, 2025, in an intimate lakeside ceremony at Gozzer Ranch Country Club, overlooking Lake Coeur d’Alene in northern Idaho. The setting was serene and picturesque—mountain views, water, and natural elegance—perfect for a wedding after a long journey together.\n\n---\n\n## A Decade-Long Love Story\n\nPatrick and Abby’s relationship began in 2015 when they met through mutual friends, though it stayed fairly private in the early years. They officially confirmed their romance on Instagram in 2016. After nearly eight years together, Patrick proposed to Abby in December 2023 during a sunrise beach walk, surrounded by roses. Their engagement was followed by a period of planning that was partly delayed due to Patrick’s acting commitments, notably filming The White Lotus in Thailand.\n\n\n## The Wedding\n\nThe ceremony itself was elegant yet understated, blending rustic charm with refined touches. Abby walked down the aisle in a classic white gown, while Patrick opted for a white tuxedo jacket paired with black pants. Bridesmaids wore bright yellow dresses, adding a cheerful contrast to the natural surroundings. Guests arrived in style—including by ferry, docking at the lakeside for the ceremony. The couple also involved Patrick heavily in planning, especially with décor and floral details, which Abby later said she “absolutely loved.”\n\n<div className=\"-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2\">\n  <div className=\"my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2\">\n    ![Maple](/static/images/article-3/image311.webp)\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2\">\n    ![Lake](/static/images/article-3/image313.jpg)\n  </div>\n    <div className=\"my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2\">\n    ![Lake](/static/images/article-3/image314.webp)\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n## Guests & Highlights\n\nThe guest list was both family‑oriented and star‑filled. Patrick’s parents, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, were in attendance, as were his sister Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt and half-brother Joseph Baena. Abby’s parents, Greg and Laura Champion, were also there. Among the celebrity guests were Jason Isaacs, Sam Nivola, and Sarah Catherine Hook—co‑stars from The White Lotus Season 3, who play his on‑screen Ratliff family. Other attendees included Rob Lowe, Iris Apatow, Olivia Jade, and many more from both the modeling and acting circles.\n\n\n\n## Reflections & What’s Next\n\nFor Patrick and Abby, the wedding marks the start of their officially married chapter—but also the culmination of a long, steady relationship built over years of growth, support, and shared experiences. Passion for each other’s careers, balancing public and private life, and staying connected despite professional demands seem to have been central to their bond.\n\n",
