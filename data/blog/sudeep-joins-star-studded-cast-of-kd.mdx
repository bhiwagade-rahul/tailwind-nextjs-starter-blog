## Backed by KVN Productions
KD – The Devil is being made on a massive budget, with Arjun Janya composing the music. The film is not only set to push the boundaries of Kannada cinema but is also being positioned as a pan-India release, with dubbed versions planned in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam.

The movie is said to explore themes of power, vengeance, and rebellion, with high-octane action sequences designed by international stunt choreographers. The makers are leaving no stone unturned to create a visually grand cinematic experience.
