## What’s Winning Hearts

Many fans are calling this third Knives Out mystery the darkest and most emotionally layered in the series. Audiences are praising the film’s gothic tone, which blends mystery with themes of faith, hypocrisy, and redemption — a shift that seems to have struck a chord.

Daniel Craig is being applauded for bringing a deeper and more nuanced take on Benoit Blanc. Fans say his performance is “one of his best” in the franchise, balancing intensity with emotional restraint.

Josh O’Connor is emerging as a fan favorite. Many viewers are calling his performance a standout, with some suggesting he even outshines the rest of the cast in key scenes.

The setting — featuring small-town churches, rituals, and religious undertones — adds a fresh layer of depth to the film, with several users appreciating how it elevates the mystery into more speculative, thematic territory.

## What Some Fans Are Not Loving

While the film is largely being praised, some viewers feel Benoit Blanc’s character is more “muted” than in previous entries. A few long-time fans miss the eccentric, larger-than-life version of Blanc seen in earlier films.
There’s also critique around the film’s ambition. Some viewers feel it tries to tackle too much, leaving certain characters underdeveloped or the core mystery a bit overcomplicated.

Pacing is another common point of discussion. Several users mentioned that the film feels a bit long in places and occasionally indulges in its own cleverness at the expense of momentum.

Compared to Knives Out and Glass Onion, some viewers feel this entry lacks the playful charm of the originals — while others welcome the darker, more serious tone as a bold evolution of the series.

## The Overall Vibe

Overall, fan reactions on Twitter are largely positive. Many see this as a bold, emotionally rich addition to the Knives Out universe. The shift in tone, stellar performances, and deeper narrative layers seem to be resonating — even if there are debates over pacing and character choices.
