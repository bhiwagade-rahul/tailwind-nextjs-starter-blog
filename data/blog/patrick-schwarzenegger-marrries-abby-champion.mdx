Patrick Schwarzenegger and Abby Champion officially tied the knot on September 6, 2025, in an intimate lakeside ceremony at Gozzer Ranch Country Club, overlooking Lake Coeur d’Alene in northern Idaho.

## A Decade-Long Love Story

Patrick and Abby’s relationship began in 2015 when they met through mutual friends, though it stayed fairly private in the early years. They officially confirmed their romance on Instagram in 2016. After nearly eight years together, Patrick proposed to Abby in December 2023 during a sunrise beach walk, surrounded by roses. Their engagement was followed by a period of planning that was partly delayed due to Patrick’s acting commitments, notably filming The White Lotus in Thailand.


## The Wedding

The ceremony itself was elegant yet understated, blending rustic charm with refined touches. Abby walked down the aisle in a classic white gown, while Patrick opted for a white tuxedo jacket paired with black pants. Bridesmaids wore bright yellow dresses, adding a cheerful contrast to the natural surroundings. Guests arrived in style—including by ferry, docking at the lakeside for the ceremony. The couple also involved Patrick heavily in planning, especially with décor and floral details, which Abby later said she “absolutely loved.”
