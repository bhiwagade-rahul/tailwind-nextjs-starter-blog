## Stree Universe: A Horror-Comedy Revolution

Since its debut in 2018, Stree has become a cult classic in Indian cinema, blending folk horror with rib-tickling comedy. Directed by Amar Kaushik and featuring Shraddha Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao, the film opened the gates for a shared supernatural universe under Maddock Films.

With follow-ups like Bhediya and Munjya, and the upcoming Stree 3, the Stree Universe (also called Maddock Horror-Comedy Universe) has solidified its place as Bollywood’s first successful horror-comedy franchise.

## Shraddha Kapoor’s Big Reveal: Animated Spin-Off Before Stree 3

- Explore the mysterious origins of the Stree legend.

- Provide more insight into Shraddha’s enigmatic character, whose real name is yet to be revealed.
